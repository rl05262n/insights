# WEBSCRAPPING USING TRACKER.GG

### BackGround:What is valorant?

#### VALORANT is a 5v5 character-based tactical FPS(First Person Shooter)developped by riot games. The game has 14 million active monthly users, and 5 million active users in north america. In this project, I webscrapped and pull data from tracker.gg to create models for analysis. (I will be using the riot developper API as well but unfortunately got timed out since I had too many requests) 

##### You can find out more at https://playvalorant.com/en-us/

### I will be using the chrome inspector (control+shift+c) in order to webscrap data from the website Tracker.gg

#### Lets Begin!

# Setup/early stages of my code: 


```python
# First I Import all the necessary libraries 
import requests              
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pprint
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```


```python
#then I define the URL as tracker_url and with a get request, parse the whole HTML page with beautiful soup
tracker_url = 'https://tracker.gg/valorant/leaderboards/ranked/all/default?page=1&act=4cb622e1-4244-6da3-7276-8daaf1c01be2'
tracker_response = requests.get(tracker_url)      # Use requests to retrieve data from a given URL
tracker_soup = BeautifulSoup(tracker_response.text, 'lxml')     # Parse the whole page using BeautifulSoup, conver it into lxml so it is readable
tracker_soup.title.string                                        #get it without the HTML tags to check the titles 
```

##### Now I find the corresponding elements within the chrome inspector  


```python
players=tracker_soup.find_all('span', {'class': 'trn-ign__username'})  #to make sure that everything is correct, I test out the player name first 
ratings=tracker_soup.find_all('td', {'class': 'stat highlight'})         #to double check to see if I got everything correct 
wins=tracker_soup.find_all('td', {'class': 'stat.collapse'})
tracker_table= pd.DataFrame(players)                                    #show the dataframe for the players 
tracker_table                                                           #everything looks good so far      
```

##### tidying up my code, getting rid of unwanted text and /n


```python
rating=tracker_soup.find('td', {'class': 'stat highlight'})                #check to see if the rating line is clean and concise

```




    <td class="stat highlight" data-v-0e94bbe2="" data-v-25cf5790=""><img class="player-rank" data-v-0e94bbe2="" data-v-25cf5790="" src="https://trackercdn.com/cdn/tracker.gg/valorant/icons/tiers/24.png"/>
                    1,257
                  </td>




```python
wins=tracker_soup.find_all('td', {'class': 'stat collapse'})                #check to see if the number of wins is clean or I need to make some edits.
wins[1]                                                    #I only set it to one to shorten the list but I see that it is a long list and realize that I have to clean the data up a bit

    <td class="stat collapse" data-v-0e94bbe2="" data-v-25cf5790="">
                      128
                    </td>




```python
wins_string = wins[1].get_text()                  #define the wins_string by setting the index to 1 and getting the 
wins_string                                       #print it out 
```




    '\n                  128\n                '




```python
wins=(''.join(wins_string.split()))                 #to get rid of the two placeholders, command joinsplit

### The solution to the problem above: 
I selected the wrong data. Select the element containing just my data, which is in the format of a table. And instead of making separate list of all the column values in regards to rank, players, ratings etc, and combining them into rows, I just had to reiterate the items representing each data row on the table. Which in this website is the <tr> element and on each row, I just had to build the data dictionary from the specific cells td. And finally, in order to get rid of the header row, I just have to select tbody as my element. Learned from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20522820/how-to-get-tbody-from-table-from-python-beautiful-soup  https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/10857/how-to-scrape-a-table-from-a-webpage and https://python-forum.io/thread-27991.html

# Attempt number 2, using table and for loop 

### Now I add everything together into a for loop


```python
table = tracker_soup.find('table', {'class': 'trn-table'})            #Using the chrome inspector, I found that table.trntable contains all the informations I need. 
players = []                                                          #define table as that by using the find function and setting the term players as an empty list
for row in table.find('tbody').find_all('tr'):                        #Setting a for loop, for each row in table, find the tbody which contains all the data I need and find all element tr
    rank, player, ignore, rating, tier, wins = row.find_all('td')     #the elements are rank, player, I put ignore here since it is a place where you can see the img of the radiant rank and it is the same image 
    wins_string = wins.get_text()                                     #like I did before, I set the parameters so that I can get rid of the annoying /n 
    wins=(''.join(wins_string.split()))                               #Using the join command to join everything together 
    rating_string=rating.get_text()                                   #same as the one for wins above
    rating=(''.join(rating_string.split()))                           #join them together 
    rating=rating.replace(',', '')                                    #replace the commas so that it shows up as 1234 instead of 1,234 taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16233593/how-to-strip-comma-in-python-string
    rank_string=rank.get_text()                                       #because there is ornaments for rank 1 to 3, when transfering the data, I got extra N/ for only rank 1 to 3 so I ran the code for the whole ranks as well to get rid of the first 3
    rank=(''.join(rank_string.split()))                               #same as above, join them together
    data = {"player": player.find('span', {'class': 'trn-ign__username'}).get_text(),  #organize the data, the columns, as player, rank, wins, rating, link 
            "rank": rank,                                                              #I define the find command here specifically because there are two classess one is trn-ign and the other is trn-ign username, defining trn-ign username  
            "wins": wins,                                                              #is the more concise one the other shows unique numbers players put at the end of their usernames
            "rating": rating,
            "link": player.find('a')['href']}                         #the last column I use to get the hyperlink that is inside the table that links to all the player's individual profiles 
    players.append(data)                                              #Add up all the data together with players and define it as a dataframe, df

### Tidying up the code in attempt number 2:

#### In order to have a "cleaner" code, I add .strip() at the end of each variable in data to get rid of the /n. The result is the same but the codes are cleaner. I discovered only after searching the internet and looking at the forum: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39870290/how-to-strip-line-breaks-from-beautifulsoup-get-text-method


```python
table = tracker_soup.find('table', {'class': 'trn-table'})                           #define table as that by using the find function
players = []                                                                         #setting the term players as an empty list
for row in table.find('tbody').find_all('tr'):                                       #same as above, with chrome inspector find all the elements 
    rank, player, ignore, rating, tier, wins = row.find_all('td')
    data = {"player": player.find('span', {'class': 'trn-ign__username'}).get_text(), #set the columns for my datasets, same as above 
            "rank": rank.get_text().strip(),                                          #instead now, I add .strip() to get rid of the annoying /n taken from the link above
            "wins": wins.get_text().strip(), 
            "rating": rating.get_text().strip().replace(',', ''),                     #like above,except put. replace right after.strip 
            "link": player.find('a')['href']}
    players.append(data)                                                               #combine the data

### Merge the data so that I can export it


```python
valorantranked = [df1, df2, df3]                                 #define the data as all three dataframes 
result = pd.concat(valorantranked)                               #set result using the panda function concat to combine them into one
```


```python
result.to_csv('ranked.csv')                                                      #Export the new dataset into my repo folder with the name "ranked.csv" function so that I can run regressions easier. 
```

## Creating a new variable:


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                #time to import the matplotlib package that I can use to plot things and run regressions 
import pandas as pd                            #In order to create a new variable, I need to export the data since I cannot do division with strings  
```


```python
df = pd.read_csv('ranked.csv')                  #set the new dataframe by using the command read to read the csv file we exported. 
df.drop('Unnamed: 0', axis = 1, inplace = True) #I saw that during the exporting process, the data created a column of unmaed:0, using thie code gets rid of it taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43983622/remove-unnamed-columns-in-pandas-dataframe
df                                              #show the dataframe

#### Converting the percentages in excel: I opened the excel file and converted all the percentages from the win% and headshot% into decimals for easier time graphing since it is much faster and easier than using astype(float) 

# Graphs:

#### Lineplot: Rank Rating by Rank 


```python
plt.plot(df['rank'],df['rating'])                                #set the parameters for my plot where x is the rank column and y is rating column
plt.xlabel('Rank')                                               #I used the function to add the x label rank
plt.ylabel('Rank Rating')                                         #I used the function to add the y label RankRating
plt.title("Rank Rating by Rank")                                  #use the function to add a title
plt.show()                                                        # Use the plt.show function to display my graph
```

#### Scatterplot: Ranked rating and total number of games won 


```python
plt.plot('wins','rating', data=df, linestyle='none', marker='.', color = 'b')      #use the command to plot out a scatter graph where the data is taken from the data function defined above and set the color of the dots to blue.
plt.ylabel('ranked rating')                                               #print the y label as ranked rating
plt.xlabel('wins')                                          #print the x label as the amount of wins
plt.title("A scatterplot between ranked rating and total number of games won",fontweight='bold')  #print the title and make the front bold 

plt.show()        #show the scatter plot 
```

## Combining the two together side by side:


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows = 1, ncols = 2, figsize=(20,10))    #combine the fig and axis and make the figure larger by using the command figsize where first number is width and the second number is height (in inches)
ax1 = plt.subplot(1,2,1) #Define the subplot area 1 with 2 rows, 2 columns, with index 1.
ax1.plot(df['rank'],df['rating']) # assigning index 1 graph to be the line graph with the data taken from dataframe of rank and rating
ax2 = plt.subplot(1,2,2) #Define the subplot area 2 with 2 rows, 2 columns, with index 1.
ax2.plot('wins','rating', data=df, linestyle='none', marker='.', color = 'b') #assigning index 2 graph to be scatter plot created earlier with the data taken from dataframe of rank and rating
fig.suptitle('Leaderboard Rank with respect to ranked rating and number of games won', fontsize=16)  #<- here, I added the title for the figure
ax1.set_title('Rank Rating by Rank') #<- Title for subfigure 1
ax1.set_xlabel('Rank on the leaderboard')  #set the x label on ax1 as the rank on the leaderboard
ax1.set_ylabel('Rank Rating')              #set the y label on ax2 as the rank rating
ax2.set_title('Ranked rating and total number of games won') #<- Title for subfigure 2
ax2.set_xlabel('Number of wins')         #set the x label on ax2 as number of wins
ax2.set_ylabel('Rank Rating')         #set the y label on ax2 as rank rating
path ='/Users/owenl/Documents/GitHub/RL/'  #define the location of where we want to save the image in
plt.savefig(path+'ranknrating.png', dpi = 800)   #save the graph as an png with dots per inch the resolution being 500
plt.show()  
```

#### From the graphs I created, we can see that there exists an obvious correlation between rank on the leaderboard and total rank rating as the number 1 player on the leaderboard, Wardel, has the most amount of rank rating. Moreover, looking at the graph on the right, we can see that, though it is fairly weak, rank rating is positively correlated with number of wins. This somewhat makes sense. The more games you play, if you can maintain a good winrate, the more games you win, the higher your rank rating. What is interesting is that the number 1 player on the leaderboard, Wardel, in this case has merely 128 number of wins, a rather small amount compare to other players. To see if he and other players are more efficient at gaining rank ratings or if there exists a pattern for efficiency, I made a new graph with seaborn. Using the Rating/win we calculated above, we plot that vs rank to see if there is a correlation between how efficient players are at gaining rank ratings. 

### Graphing with seaborn  


```python
import seaborn as sns                                             #import seaborn as sns 
sns.jointplot('rank', 'rating/wins',data=df, kind='reg')          #use the command to make a jointplot, good for regression analysis
path ='/Users/owenl/Documents/GitHub/RL/'  #define the location of where we want to save the image in
plt.savefig(path+'seaborn.png', dpi = 800)   #save the graph as an png with dots per inch the resolution being 800
```

#### Though not apparent, there exists a correlation between the player rank and rating/wins. It makes sense to an extenet as if some is the rank one player, they are miles ahead of everyone else in terms of mechanics and game knowledge and it is expected that they will be more efficient at winning. Therefore, their ranked rating gained per win should reflect that and be slightly more than someone who is ranked lower.


##### Now to test my hypothesis of better players should have better individual stats with the data gathered by creating the for loop. The axis of the graph is blacked out since some of the data are unavailable and is inconsistent since the data gathered is depedent on cloudflare timing you out or not. But cleaner data can be obtained straight from accessing the tracker.gg API but creating an account

###  Graphs with respect to individual stats and ranked rating(for reference/analysis): since they are all more or less the same I did not put them side by side as they would display similar data and trend.

plt.plot(df['rating'],df['Damaged/rounds'])                                #set the parameters for my plot where x is the ranked rating column and y is average damager per round
plt.xlabel('Ranked Rating')                                               #I used the function to add the x label ranked rating

# What I realized after making the different graphs:  

## It is clear, especially when looking at the linegraphs on individual statistics and ranked rating, that there isn't really a correlation between the best player, wardell, vs the "worst" player in the ladder since each player may play a different way, have a different playstyle that corresponds to their personality, etc. Many top players have negative KD, more death than kills, yet they are ahead of the pack on the ranked ladder. This means that individual stats have no bearing in terms of winning on a team and other factors such as the mood or environment matters more.

### For coefficient and interpretation, please look through the R notebook.
